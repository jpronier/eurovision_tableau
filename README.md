This project is part of a 3 month Data Analytics Bootcamp in 2022. The last 2 weeks were dedicated to the learning of Tableau and creating a small project. 

The Eurovision Song Contest is an internationally televised songwriting competition, organised by the European Broadcasting Union and featuring participants chosen by EBU member broadcasters representing their countries from across Europe and beyond.

The data used comes from eurovision_meta in the excel file linked to this repository. is 0 columns and 648 rows. It contains data about the eurovision song contest between 1998 to 2012. 
Among the features used there are country ranking, jury points, duration of song, single singer or group, gender of performers and additional numerical columns used. 
Dealing with countries allowed me to communicate results and insights using a map and making a live dashboard that updates the map.
